                                            âœ¨âœ¨ðŸ‘‰runBlocking() function in kotlinâœ¨âœ¨ðŸ‘ˆ

ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€âœ¨run blocking will block the main thread and the delay function will not block the main thread.

//when we use delay ,we can now also use UI,but when we runBlocking function ,we block the UI thread and will not be able to 
//use UI operations or  UI updates.

//runBlocking function is useful when we want to call the suspend function ,but do not want the coroutine behaviour.

//if you have suspend function (like delay function) and want to call that from the main thread ,then u can use the runBlocking function.

//whatever we write in the runBlocking() function will be in the sync with the main thread.
