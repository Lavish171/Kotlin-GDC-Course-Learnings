We all know that Inheritance is the backbone of every Object-Oriented Programming language. It is a process
of deriving or using the properties and characteristics of one class by the other. In simple words, if a 
class named ClassA is having some variables and functions and another class named ClassB is inheriting 
the ClassA, then, ClassB will use the variables and methods of ClassA. Here, ClassA is called the Parent
Class and ClassB is called the Child Class. Inheritance enables re-usability.

As you know that MindOrks has various online courses like Android for Professionals, Android for Beginners,
and Data Structures & Algorithms. So, these are different courses but they share something. For enrolling 
in any of the three courses, you have to first register yourself, then you have to pay for the course and 
after completion of the course, your certificate will be generated. Now, think of the same situation in the
Object-Oriented manner. Think of MindOrks as one class, AndroidPro(for the course named as “Android for Professionals”)
as one class, AndroidBeg(for the course named as “Android for Beginners”) as one class, and DSAlgo(for the course named
as “Data Structures & Algorithm”) as one class. Now, AndroidPro, AndroidBeg, and DSAlgo has three steps in common i.e. 
courseReg(), feePay(), and certificateGeneration(). So, instead of implementing these three methods separately in all
the three classes, we can implement these methods in the MindOrks class and then use the methods by inheriting the MindOrks class. 
Here, MindOrks is the Parent class and AndroidPro, AndroidBeg, and DSAlgo are the Child class.


⭐⭐✨✨👉👉All the classes,functions and all the variables are final by default in kotlin.✨

🍀🍀🍀 ✨The “open” Keyword
In Kotlin, all the classes are final by default i.e. they can’t be inherited by default.
This is opposite to what we learned in Java. In Java, you have to make your class final explicitly.

So, to make a class inheritable to the other classes, you must mark it with the open keyword 
otherwise you will get an error saying “type is final so can’t be inherited”.🍀🍀🍀✨
